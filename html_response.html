Back-propagation (BP) algorithms have been extensively studied for their ability to learn complex neural networks. Various methods have been developed to enhance the performance of these algorithms, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.

One notable method is the back-propagation algorithm, which is used in the back-propagation algorithm to train neural networks. This algorithm is particularly effective in learning complex neural networks due to its ability to converge quickly and efficiently<a href="1:Multilayer neural networks trained with the back-propagation algorithm constitute the best example of a successful gradient-based learning technique." class="marker blue">1</a>.

Another approach involves the use of graph transformer networks, which are designed to handle the variability of 2D shapes and can be trained globally using gradient-based methods. These networks allow for the combination of multiple modules, including segmentation recognition and language modeling, to achieve better performance<a href="1:A new learning paradigm, called graph transformer networks (GTN), allows such multimodule systems to be trained globally using gradient-based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure." class="marker blue">2</a>.

In the context of image classification and multilingual neural machine translation, GPipe has been shown to be effective. It allows for the scaling of deep neural network capacities and has been used to train large-scale neural networks on various tasks, including image classification and multilingual machine translation<a href="2:GPipe provides the flexibility of scaling a variety of different networks to gigantic sizes efficiently." class="marker yellow">3</a>.

For object detection, ViT has been compared against other methods like the back-propagation algorithm. While ViT is known for its ability to handle complex tasks like object detection, it has been found to be less effective in certain scenarios. For instance, ViT has been shown to perform well in object detection tasks but may struggle in other complex tasks<a href="3:We explore the plain, non-hierarchical Vision Transformer (ViT) as a backbone network for object detection." class="marker green">4</a>.

Overall, the effectiveness of back-propagation algorithms in learning complex neural networks depends on the specific task at hand. While some methods like GPipe and ViT are effective for certain tasks, others may be more suitable for complex or high-dimensional problems. The choice of algorithm depends on the nature of the task and the desired performance metrics.
