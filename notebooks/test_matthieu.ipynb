We would like to move towards more\\ngeneral systems which can perform many tasks – eventually\\nwithout the need to manually create and label a training\\ndataset for each one. Natural language processing tasks, such as ques-\\ntion answering, machine translation, reading com-\\nprehension, and summarization, are typically\\napproached with supervised learning on task-\\nspeciﬁc datasets. We demonstrate that language\\nmodels begin to learn these tasks without any ex-\\nplicit supervision when trained on a new dataset\\nof millions of webpages called WebText. When\\nconditioned on a document plus questions, the an-\\nswers generated by the language model reach 55\\nF1 on the CoQA dataset - matching or exceeding\\nthe performance of 3 out of 4 baseline systems\\nwithout using the 127,000+ training examples. The capacity of the language model is essential\\nto the success of zero-shot task transfer and in-\\ncreasing it improves performance in a log-linear\\nfashion across tasks.

These ﬁndings suggest\\na promising path towards building language pro-\\ncessing systems which learn to perform tasks from\\ntheir naturally occurring demonstrations. The dominant approach to creating ML systems is to col-\\nlect a dataset of training examples demonstrating correct\\nbehavior for a desired task, train a system to imitate these\\nbehaviors, and then test its performance on independent\\nand identically distributed (IID) held-out examples. This\\nhas served well to make progress on narrow experts.

Our suspicion is that the prevalence of single task training\\non single domain datasets is a major contributor to the lack\\nof generalization observed in current systems. Progress\\ntowards robust systems with current architectures is likely\\nto require training and measuring performance on a wide\\nrange of domains and tasks.

However, no actual training questions or\\nanswers are in WebText since CoQA was released after the\\ncutoff date for links in WebText. Recent work in computer vision has shown that common im-\\nage datasets contain a non-trivial amount of near-duplicate\\nimages. For instance CIFAR-10 has 3.3% overlap between\\ntrain and test images (Barz & Denzler, 2019). This results in\\nan over-reporting of the generalization performance of ma-\\nchine learning systems.

Therefore it\\nis important to analyze how much test data also shows up in\\nthe training data. On LAMBADA, the average overlap is 1.2%.

Recalculating metrics when excluding\\nall examples with any overlap shifts results from 8.6 to 8.7\\nperplexity and reduces accuracy from 63.2% to 62.9%. This\\nvery small change in overall results is likely due to only 1\\nin 200 examples having signiﬁcant overlap. To study this we created Bloom ﬁlters containing 8-grams\\nof WebText training set tokens.

We further veriﬁed the low false positive\\nrate by generating 1M strings, of which zero were found by\\nthe ﬁlter. Overall, our analysis suggests that data overlap between\\nWebText training data and speciﬁc evaluation datasets pro-\\nvides a small but consistent beneﬁt to reported results. How-\\never, for most datasets we do not notice signiﬁcantly larger\\noverlaps than those already existing between standard train-\\ning and test sets, as Table 6 highlights. These Bloom ﬁlters let us calculate, given a dataset, the\\npercentage of 8-grams from that dataset that are also found\\nin the WebText training set.

Somewhat\\nsurprisingly, many datasets have larger overlaps with their\\nown training splits, with an average of 5.9% overlap. Understanding and quantifying how highly similar text im-\\npacts performance is an important research question. Better\\nde-duplication techniques such as scalable fuzzy matching\\ncould also help better answer these questions. For now, we\\nrecommend the use of n-gram overlap based de-duplication\\nas an important veriﬁcation step and sanity check during the\\ncreation of training and test splits for new NLP datasets. Our approach optimizes for recall, and while manual inspec-\\ntion of the overlaps shows many common phrases, there are\\nmany longer matches that are due to duplicated data. This is\\nnot unique to WebText. For instance, we discovered that the\\ntest set of WikiText-103 has an article which is also in the\\ntraining dataset. Since there are only 60 articles in the test\\nset there is at least an overlap of 1.6%.4 Potentially more\\nworryingly, 1BW has an overlap of nearly 13.2% with its\\nown training set according to our procedure.
