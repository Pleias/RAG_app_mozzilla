# Dataset

To fine-tune the model we started by taking unstructured questions/queries and breaking them down to understand their main topics and key points. This involved rewriting them to highlight the main topics and remove any vague language.

&#x20;Then, we added specific details like time frames to ensure the searches target the most recent information. We also expanded the key concepts by including related terms and topics to cover all important aspects of the query.

&#x20;Finally, we organized the queries in a way that fits the structure of advanced search tool of OpenAlex to enhance search effectiveness.  Throughout this process, we made sure each transformation made the queries more precise, relevant, and comprehensive, helping us find the right information more easily.
